# UniversityProjects
This repository is just a collection of a few homeworks that i had done. This include homeworks, projects in class or just me playing and creating silly things just to learn.
The code could be written in spanish language or english (variables).
If you need a code from this repository you can take it, you dont have to ask me for permission or anything like that.
So i think thats all. I will be updating the repository if i create new projects. 
And if this repository help in some sort of way, you can donate in order to help me buy maruchan (cars use gasoline, i use maruchan as fuel to code).
